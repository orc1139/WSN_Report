Parking detection systems are not the rare thing to see. 
However, it is the cost and installation that makes them attractive only on big park houses.
Our project confirmed that a more cost-effective alternative is possible using wireless sensor networks.
Implementing them on every parking space can only bring benefits to both drivers and parking operators, and potentially to a city administration as well.

In our implementation we focused on low power consumption, ease of installation, reliability, error detection and fast reaction times.
In the demonstration on the lab, it was seen that the routing protocol hybrid meets these requirements.
Additionally, the solution we devised is simple, effective and uses very little resources (event-driven updates, small packet sizes, low network flooding).
Also, the modularity of the software allowed small adjustments to provide all the required functionalities for each of the three roles.
Lastly, the GUI adds a user-friendly way to present the parking space information and gain a broad overview of the general status.
